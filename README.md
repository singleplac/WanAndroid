This project uses RecyclerView + Retrofit2 + WebView to build a news App. 

The first fragment shows the list of news with its title and author name. When you click on the title, the fragment will jump into another fragment, which is the link to the original article.
The first fragment could be scrolled down to load more items from the JSON link into RecyclerView.
